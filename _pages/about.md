I am currently a Ph.D. student from the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, under the supervision of Prof. Haiping Huang. Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the same university in 2021. My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, natural language processing, AI for software security, and trustworthy AI.
