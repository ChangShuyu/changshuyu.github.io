I am a Ph.D. candidate from the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications (NJUPT) and my study is supervised by Prof. Haiping Huang (2022-current).
Before that, I received my B.E. degree from the same institution in 2021.
My research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning, and natural language processing.
